Method Overriding - Subclass having same method 
Rules: 
 IS - A Inheritence
 same parameters and same name should be followed

Static method cannot be overrided 
(Main method also cannot be overrided since it is static)
Because static is bound with class
instance method is bound with an object

Static belongs to class area
instance belongs to heap area
